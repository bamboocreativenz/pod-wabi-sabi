##Scope
The financial agreement lays out the way in which we go about forming financial commitments to pod members (salaries). It focuses on the process of how we form commitments and review them. It does not stipulate a metric for determing the fiscal value of a prospective member, rather it takes the paradigm that this will be determined by due process. 

##Process
###Session 1: Context
This session is to understand the financial desires of each participating member. Each member petitioning for a financial commitment shall be given the opportunity to explain there financial plan for the next year, providing context such as what they are working towards purchasing (travel, property, cars, lifestyle, etc...), They should also inform the others of relevant expierience and skills and disclose their last annualarised salary. The goal here is to have a fiscal understanding of each person. We can treat this information as a problem to be collectvely solved as a group.

###Between Sessions
In the week between meetings each partipating member should post a range indicating the salary they are looking to recieve. This should be accompanied by a comment/statement summarising the context given. eg "I'm all about the money for the next year", "I only want to work part time and only in js" or "I'm going travelling so need to chase the dollars for the first half of the year and than want to focus on spending half my time filling the pipeline using my expierience in viral
marketing". The comments are pretty flexable and there are no rules governing what should be in them.

###Session 2: Discussion & Commitment
Each persons salary range and comment should be printed off and posted on a wall. In this session each person will be put on the spot to talk about the figure. It is the responsability of the group to hold each person to account and ask questions that clarify how their proposed salary is justified and the kind of work they see themselves doing to receive this. This can be thought of as the work they can do rather than want to (of course these can be one and the same). eg "I want to work in js, but am better at C#. As I am more focused on earning money at the moment I tell the group that by consulting in C# I should command a higher salary as we can charge more for my services". 

An important consideration will be how much we need to earn per person in order to be sustainable. We will use a 1.5 x the salary to determine this. Asking the question "Can we charge you out at x?" will be a standard. 

Once everyone has had the oportunity to be in the spot light (one round) we will go around again and each person may say the figure they wish to recieve and we will record this as the persons salary. During this round anyone may raise on objection to an amount. The process is halted while the group investigate the validity of the objection. If this cannot be resolved the session comes to a close and the group shall schedule a new context session for another day.

If all petitioning members finish this round with a recorded salary, let this be recorded as a fiscal commitment between the pod and the person. Each commitment should be a seperate document in the pods bond/commitments folder.

!IMPORTANT: Remember this process is about collectively solving each others fiscal problems. These conversations can be hard and stressful, take your time and be empathetic.

##Commitment Reviews
All commitments will be reviewed at 3 months, 6 months and 1 year after forming. After this it will be annually.

A review will look at the money earned by a person and as group we will problem solve the result. THIS IS NOT A PERFORMANCE REVIEW!

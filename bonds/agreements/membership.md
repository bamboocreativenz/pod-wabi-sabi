## Definition
Membership of the pod can be understood to be belonging to the pod. This can be characterised in three ways:
 1. A member has a vote/say in what happens in the pod,
 2. Can propose to add, modify or remove a Bond,
 3. Put forward a candidate for membership.

## Process
Joining a pod is characterised as hard in the OpenOS model in practicality it requires all current members to be in agreement for the candidate to join.

## Obligations
note: this may be moved into a new agreement in the future.
Being a pod member is a commitment to actively participating in pod coms. This can be broken into two categories:
 1. Proposals: Handled by Loomio, All members must vote on a proposal.
 2. General: Mainly slack, but also Loomio threads and github. Discretionary activity - but no ones an island

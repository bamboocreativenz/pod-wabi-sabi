#web-gis / map-making / spatial apps

*this is in ideas for now, as the particulars for this market are far from concrete*

Iain suspects, from previous experience in the GIS industry, that there may be significant opportunities for our team to develop apps / solutions that target the GIS / spatial sector.

##Background on the sector

The GIS desktop software industry is currently dominated by one major player - [ESRI](www.esri.com). They've been in the game a long time, and successfully pushed their platform into the universities that taught GIS - as a result, grads expect to be using ESRI software in the workplace, and companies expect to hire people who have experience using ESRI.
While there are differences of opinion on the quality of the ESRI platform, it is expensive for a business to buy into - there are a ton of resources out there purely focused on enabling a justification of GIS from a business ROI perspective. Many ESRI clients are government organisations, or large enterprise workplaces.

Over recent years an open-source alternative has emerged - [QGIS](www.qgis.org) - and this is now tentatively being taught in universities aswell. However, many businesses are already locked into the ESRI ecosystem, or don't see a pathway of liability that would encourage them to shift to open-source software (there are some notable exceptions - NIWA for example https://www.niwa.co.nz/our-services/software-tools/quantum-map).

##Our opportunity?
I see two points that might provide opportunity for our team in this sector:
- many in the industry are frustrated with the ESRI platform. Web solutions that ESRI offers are relatively locked down and out-of-the-box. There may be potential to offer low-cost, one-off solutions to particular problems that organisations otherwise locked into ESRI have.
- there are (surely!) small and medium enterprises who have data with spatial aspects, who would like to understand that data better, but who aren't financially in a position to invest in an entire system. This again may provide us the opportunity to develop one-off solutions that address particular problems, or even small platforms that are more general for exploring data.

##Steps
Iain to try and get a feel for the state of players in the industry by hitting up some contacts.
Awareness from team / salespeople that we can probably do these sorts of small applications if the opportunity arises.

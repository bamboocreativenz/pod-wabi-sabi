#a platform for mapping

*rough ideas around the notion of a platform for spatial work*

This differs from the web-gis idea in that it is more focused on a platform, rather than a service like web-gis.
And it's much rougher - I'm much more unclear as to whether there is a demand for this, and what the shape of the platform might look like. Though it may be a case of the Jobs "they don't know what they want till they see it".

##NOTES

- all the components to build an open-source GIS / map with data platform already exist (and devs from MapBox have even said so). There may be value in putting these together into an easy-to-use platform, and indeed some suspect that MapBox's latest round of funding will mean they push towards doing this.
- I personally wonder whether there is great value in trying to do the whole caboodle, especially if a really good team like MapBox are doing it anyway.
- There may be more value in publishing a smaller, generic platform that can be rolled out with pluggable additions to clients.

- A big question to direct thinking here: 'what would it take for an organisation to ditch their enterprise GIS?'
  - what would a solution need to do better? what currently sucks about ArcGIS / Geomedia / MapInfo etc?
  - what sucks about the day-to-day tasks of a GIS Analyst that could be improved? automation, tools etc.
